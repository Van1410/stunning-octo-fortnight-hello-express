- This Mini App will first prompt users to a login page that has authentication.
- After logging in you are prompted to the shoes collection database where you can create, read, update, or delete shoes using CRUD.
- The Mini App also uses Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, RestfulAPI also using normalize.css, Bootstrap 5, and jQuery/UI.
